# A Subtly Technical Escape Room: Inspiring Interest in Algorithms & Computer Science

Many students dismiss computer science as impenetrable, exclusive, or irrelevant to daily life. This escape room circumvents this by being subtly technical: students unknowingly solve logic problems addressed by common algorithms. When the connection is revealed, they learn not to underestimate their ability, to approach algorithms critically, and that computer science is not so daunting after all!

## Overview
Students work in teams of 3-5 to solve puzzles that will help them get through their theoretical first year at college. Each puzzle challenges them to use deductive logic, and the correct answers correspond with locks in the room that advance them to the next puzzle. With 60 minutes to escape and four puzzles to solve, the group follows the clues to develop an algorithm, learning at the end what theyâ€™ve done, where it is used, and why it is important - all within the context of surviving the semester.

Regardless of where academic exploration takes the participants in the future, it is important to demystify algorithms. It is critical to encourage students to question algorithms that influence our daily behaviors since algorithms are only as good as the people who write them. In addition, learning about algorithms gives students a valuable new way of looking at the world and approaching problems. We can encourage students not to underestimate their own intelligence, nor overestimate that of an algorithm.

## Running Your Own Escape Room

### "Room" Set Up & Requirements
This escape room can be run either virtually or in person. In person, the escape room can be done in any room - you just need to print the material and add 4 locks and lock boxes! The locks need to be able to handle specific combinations - please see the answer key for the required combinations. Virtually, proctors can act as the "locks", providing the material once the team successfully supplies the right combination. **A web version of the escape room materials is in the works and will be added soon to help enhance the experience for proctors and participants!**

Participants can also use a calculator, highlighter, pens, and notepad (traditional college materials). All of these things can be done using the computer if the team is virtual. This escape room is designed for minimum cost and maximum portability.

### Setting the Stage
*Resource location: `materials/0 - before_time_starts/`*

Proctors should review the `introduction.pdf` with the team. If the escape room is virtual, go over the conceptual locks using the `locks.pdf`. If the escape room is in person, let the teams search for the hidden (or hidden in plain sight) lock boxes.

Answer any questions the team might have, encourage them to use their hints, and start the 60 minute timer!

### Once Time Starts

In person, give participants the materials for Problem 1 or have the participants start searching for the materials in the room. Virtually, have participants open the folder for Problem 1. Participants will work as a team to navigate through the remainder of the escape room. Proctors will only intervene to distribute hints when requested. Some problems are purposely ambiguous to model a traditional escape room.

Each problem folder may contain a congratulatory message for solving the previous problem, a PDF file with the next question, and any additional materials necessary to solve the problem at hand.

#### Problem 1
*Resource location: `materials/1 - opens_with_time_start/`*

- **Problem**: `can_you_survive_physics?.pdf`.
- **Additional materials**:  `amy.pdf`, `bui.pdf`, `caden.pdf`, `dariya.pdf`, `elena.pdf`, `felix.pdf`

#### Problem 2
*Resource location: `materials/2 - opens_with_first_lock/`*

- **Congratulatory message**: `you_passed_physics!.pdf`.
- **Problem**: `can_you_make_your_midterm?.pdf`.
- **Additional materials**:  `campus_map.pdf`

#### Problem 3
*Resource location: `materials/3 - opens_with_second_lock/`*

- **Congratulatory message**: `you_made_your_midterm!.pdf`.
- **Problem**: `can_you_decide_roomates?.pdf`.
- **Additional materials**:  `aniyah.pdf`, `duong.pdf`, `eva.pdf`, `gabriel.pdf`, `laura.pdf`, `saleema.pdf`, `doodle.png`

#### Problem 4
*Resource location: `materials/4 - opens_with_third_lock/`*

- **Congratulatory message:** `roomate_success!.pdf`.
- **Problem:** `can_you_use_your_tools?.pdf`.
- **Additional materials**:  `mentor_assignments.pdf`, `twitter_newsfeed.pdf`, `wireless_networks.pdf`

### Finish Line

*Resource location: `materials/5 - opens_with_forth_lock/`*

When participants solve problem four and open the last lock box, they will reveal the final congratulatory message `you_survived!.pdf`. Proctors will debrief as they see fit, possibly asking the participants how the escape room affected their view of algorithms. If participants failed to escape, proctors can reveal the reasoning for the correct answers to the problems.
